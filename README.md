## Installing Bene
The preferred way to install Bene is via the [Bene-project](https://github.com/thinkshout/bene-project) template.

## Running Tests
These instructions assume you have used Composer to install Bene.

### Behat
    $ cd MYPROJECT/web/profiles/bene
    $ /path/to/MYPROJECT/bin/behat

If necessary, edit behat.local.yml to match your environment. Generally you
will not need to do this.
